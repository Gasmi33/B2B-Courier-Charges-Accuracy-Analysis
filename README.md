Text Analysis: Process We Can Follow
Text Analysis involves various techniques such as text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic modelling, and text classification. Text analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and making sense of large volumes of text data, which is prevalent in various domains, including news articles, social media, customer reviews, and more.

Below is the process you can follow for the task of Text Analysis as a Data Science professional:

Gather the text data from various sources.
Clean and preprocess the text data.
Convert the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.
Analyze the text data to gain insights.
Create relevant features from the text data if necessary.
Select appropriate NLP models for your task.
So, the process of Text Analysis starts with collecting textual data (structured or unstructured). I found an ideal dataset for this task. You can download the data from here.
